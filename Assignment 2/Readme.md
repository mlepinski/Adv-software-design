# Reflection

You are asked to write a brief individual reflection. (This is a task for you, not your team.) The reflection can be informal. The writing can be unpolished. However, please be thoughtful in your answers to the following questions:

- Question 1: What could my team have done differently in Assignment 1 to make it easier for future developers to make use of the files that we created?
- Question 2: For the API you worked with Assignment 2, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the API (the one the professor created). To what extent did it succeed in facilitating communication between the components of your system? And in what ways was it an impediment to the work you were doing in Assignment 2?

**The Reflection is due on Thursday, Sept 28**
