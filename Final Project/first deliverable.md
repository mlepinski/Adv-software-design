# First Objectives for Final Project

## Due: Monday, October 2nd

Your team has three tasks for the first week of the project

- Determine your Team Name. 
- Write a Team Agreement that describes how your team will operate. This is a living document. Make an initial draft and then edit it as needed over the course of the term.
- Initial Selection of a Project Topic. This can be revisited in consultation with the professor, but it is important to have an initial direction.

## Team Names

I would encourage you to be creative in selecting a team name. If you aren't sure what name to pick, my suggestion would be to go with an animal. 

## Team Agreement

The goal of this document is to get everyone on the same page with regards to how the team will get work accomplished.

This is a living document. Put it somewhere that all team members can easily access it. Then add things, change things, and clarify things as needed. 

Here are my suggestions regardings things that you should cover in this document.

- What tools will you use for communication? Slack? Discord? Email? Group Text Messages? Carrier Pidgeons?
- How often do you expect each person to check project related messages? If you ask a question, when should you expect a response? Are there hours of the day when messages should not be sent?
- How do you keep track of who is working on what task? Trello? Some other kanban board? Assigning GitHub Issues? Something else?
- **It is vital that every decision the group makes is recorded**. (If something isn't recorded, it hasn't been decided.) How/Where does your group record decisions?
